# Sorting-algorithm-Visualiser

This project helps visualises 6 different sorting algorithms which are\
1.Bubble sort.\
2.Insertion sort.\
3.Selection sort.\
4.Merge sort.\
5.Quick sort.\
6.Heap sort.

It asks to input a set of randomly arranged positive integers and allow you to choose any one of the above algorithm.Then by the use of horizontal histogram,it shows each step of the algorithm with a time delay of 500ms.\

When you run the program,you need to input total number of elements.Then you need to enter each element one by one.
